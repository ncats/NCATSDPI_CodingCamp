# NCATS DPI Coding Camps

NCATS DPI has been running coding camps since 2021.  The goal of the camp is to provide assisted learning in coding concepts. The camp tailors to beginner or seasoned computational experts and no previous experience is required.

At the end of this course, participants will have been introduced to GitHub and team coding best practices. Depending on their level of proficiency in programming prior to starting the camp, the expectation is for participants to have advanced their knowledge and skills in a particular language or application of software/code of their choice.

General materials for each camp is organized by folder.
