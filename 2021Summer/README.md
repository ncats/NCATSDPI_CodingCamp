# 2021 NCATS Summer Coding Camp

## Course Goals
The goal of the camp is to provide assisted learning in coding concepts.  The camp tailors to beginner or seasoned computational experts and no previous experience is required.  

At the end of this course, participants will have been introduced to GitHub and team coding best practices.  Depending on their level of proficiency in programming prior to starting the camp, the expectation is for participants to have advanced their knowledge and skills in a particular language or application of software/code of their choice.

## Course logistics
### The Basics:
The camp will last 8 weeks and we will meet weekly on Thursdays 11-noon
The camp will be open to all of NCATS (trainees and staff)
The commitment would be 1 hour in-person time per week for 8 weeks, plus ad hoc slacking back and forth.
There will be two introductory lectures: 1) introducing what the camp is about so folks can decide on whether or not to join; 2) introducing the course organization and use of GitHub, and definition of projects.
At the end of the 8 weeks, everyone will share the results of their project (e.g. 15 min talk)
The camp will be capped to 20 participants

### Teaching Assistants:
Each participant will be choosing a teaching assistant (TA) to work with for the entire 8 weeks. There are 8 Teaching Assistants for this camp:
1. Nathan Hotalling (Python, VSCode)
2. Shawn Li (Python)
3. Ewy Mathé (R/Rstudio)
4. Jorge Neyra (Python, JavaScript/HTML)
5. Trung Nguyen (R, Python, or other)
6. Kyle Spencer (R/Rstudio, RShiny)
7. Tongan Zhao (Python, Java)
8. Mark Williams (Python, Java, Perl)

_Important note_: these projects are offered as examples and are particularly useful for participants that may not have a clear idea of what they would like to work on.  If participants have a data set or a clear project they would like to develop throughout this camp, we can certainly accommodate this and find a TA that matches required skills for guidance.

### Working Environment:
We will rely on GitHub and Slack for communication throughout this course.  
Our GitHub site is: https://github.com/ncats/2021CodingCamp
Our Slack Channel is on the NCATS instance and is called: 2021_summercodingcamp

Instructions on how to communicate via GitHub and Slack will be provided in the introductory lectures.

## High-level timeline:
- Week1 (Monday): Introduction
- Week 2: Select project, get set up on GitHub/Slack, start a timeline for your project
- Week 3: Set up your environment to complete project, finalize timeline, work on your first task
- Weeks 4-6: Keep working on tasks, revise timeline as appropriate
- Week 7: Prep your final presentation for last week, maybe start presentations that week
- Week 8: Final project presentation
